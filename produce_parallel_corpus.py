# load the classes and methods hashmap

# regex to find / split all potential functions, classnames, variables etc.
# for each:
    # if they're in the hashmap ...
        # add it to the code side for that code snippet / "data point"

# regex to find docstrings

# regex to find first line of docstring

# regex to find all English in code like Facebook did.

    #-- • Method name: We extract the method name and combine it with the class name in which the method is contained.
    #HARD • Method invocations: Method invocations are arguably the most important information inside a code block because they give hints about what is happening in the code. Other features like control flow are also important but cannot be easily expressed in natural language.
    #HARD • Enums: Unlike local variables, these constants are carefully named, containing meaningful information about the state of program.
    #-- • String literals: They usually include human–facing text and documentation, both containing useful words which we extract.
    #-- • Comments: They contain very useful information as they are already natural language descriptions of code.
